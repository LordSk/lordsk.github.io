      <description>0xed is an hexadecimal editor. View data interpreted as common types such as ASCII, Integer and Float.
Setup as many panels as you want, each with its own color gradient and data type.
Inspect selected byte string with the Inspector panel, Search for any type of data with the search command.
0xed is currently being worked on and thus is not recommended for professional use as of now.

      <description>Resacred is a complete remake of Sacred Gold.
First we start by reverse-engineering the game from the executable binary and binary resource files, using tools such as x64dbg, IDA Pro, and 0xed.
We then use that information to build a modern engine suited for the game. In particular, DirectX 7 was used at the time to render the game, we now use an asynchronous OpenGL renderer.
After months of work we can display every map sector, as well as the world overview grid.</description>
