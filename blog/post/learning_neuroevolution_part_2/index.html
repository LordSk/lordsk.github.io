<p>Last time we established what the basic concept of <strong>neuroevolution</strong> is and I used a simple diagram to illustrate it.
That diagram is actually slightly false. For simplification I omitted how we repopulate after selecting only the fittest specimen.
Most of the time, a type of <strong>crossover</strong> technique is used, but we could also simply clone the better specimen.
Here is the fixed version.</p>

<p><img src="/img/neuroevolution_2.png" alt="neuroevolution2" title="neuroevolution2" /></p>

<p>I will now go over each step in more details and explain a few techniques I employed for each of them.</p>

<h3 id="evaluation-fitness">Evaluation / Fitness</h3>

<p>First is the evaluation step. We run our network population (forward propagation) then calculate the <strong>fitness</strong> achieved by each NN.
Fitness is an arbitrarily computed number representing how well a specimen did during its simulated lifetime. Here is a example:</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m sure most of you are familiar with this little game. The goal is simple, go as far <strong>right</strong> as you can.
The fitness is then <strong>how far right we went before dying</strong> (the top right score on the video). In this case fitness is easy grasp as a concept and thus easy to compute.
However as your problem gets harder to resolve so will the fitness to compute. This is arguably the most important cog in our machine. A bad fitness function will render the system
unable to evolve NNs properly or slow down the evolution by a lot. I will explain more when presenting the project I applied neuroevolution to.</p>

<h3 id="selection">Selection</h3>

<p>We now have our criteria for choosing the best specimen. There are several means of <strong>parent</strong> selection. We can sort NNs by fitness and eliminate the worst 50% and that would work.
Yet I found using a more random method yield better results. My favorite was <strong>selection tournament</strong>.
You pit specimen against random opponents multiple times and the victor becomes a parent (the best fitness wins). <strong>Selection roulette</strong> is very good as well.
Imagine a long band with all the fitnesses added up one after the other. Where you land on the band determines the parent. Bigger fitnesses have a lot more chance to be landed on,
while still leaving a chance for a low scoring specimen.</p>

<p><img src="/img/selection_roulette.png" alt="selection roulette" title="selection roulette" /></p>

<h3 id="crossover">Crossover</h3>

<p><strong>Crossover</strong> is the mating part, mixing two parents to produce a &ldquo;child&rdquo;. There are a lot of ways to do this as well. Some choose to use a genome model, assigning genes to specimen and converting them
back to weight values or even different neuron topologies (Neuroevolution is also referred as <strong>Genetic algorithm</strong>). I personally didn&rsquo;t go down that path and stuck with weights instead.
Here are two examples of crossover techniques.</p>

<p><img src="/img/crossover_1.png" alt="crossover" title="crossover" /></p>

<p><em>A,B,C are gene letters, but they could also be each connection weight value</em></p>

<h3 id="mutation">Mutation</h3>

<p>Finally, <strong>mutation</strong>. Mutation, in our case, will alter/reset one or more connection weight depending on the connection rate. We have to fine tune this rate in order to have a correct evolution system.
Too much mutation leads to randomness and no refining, too little will considerably slow down the process. We may also choose to keep a few specimen from mutating
in order to not lose the best solution in the next generation.</p>

<h3 id="burds">Burds</h3>

<p>It is time to put all this theory into practice. I created a little simulation where 2D birds teach themselves how to fly. Here is a sneak peek,
I will talk more about it in the next post, see you then!</p>
