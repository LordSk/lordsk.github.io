      <description>Preface 0xed is a hexadecimal data viewer/editor that I am currently working on. The idea to make my own arose after vainly searching for a decent one. I actually found one which had almost all of the basic features I wanted to use, 010 editor, but unfortunately it is neither free nor open source. Thus I can&amp;rsquo;t really tamper with it or make it &amp;ldquo;better&amp;rdquo;.
Basic features I want to be able to visualize file data as either hex, int16, float32 and so on.</description>
