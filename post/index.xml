      <description>Last time we established what the basic concept of neuroevolution is and I used a simple diagram to illustrate it. That diagram is actually slightly false. For simplification I omitted how we repopulate after selecting only the fittest specimen. Most of the time, a type of crossover technique is used, but we could also simply clone the better specimen. Here is the fixed version.
I will now go over each step in more details and explain a few techniques I employed for each of them.</description>

      <description>Ever since I heard about neural networks I wanted to learn how they work and how to use them. Today (deep) neural networks are being used in more and more domains, ranging from the popular self-driving vehicle system, to diverse uses in medicine or even speech recognition and synthesis. That trend is not going to stop anytime soon, which meant it was time for me to start my journey to understanding this new revolutionary tool.</description>
