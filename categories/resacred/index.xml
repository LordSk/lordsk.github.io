      <description>Introduction Sacred is an old 2004 game, a RPG similar to Diablo. I remember getting it for free at the time, attached to my PC Gamer magazine. It was my first real RPG game I ever got my hands on, and it was amazing. I have many great memories playing this game, overcoming difficult enemies, completing quests, and dropping loot! Oh the satisfaction.
The year is now 2017 and I wanted to revisit Sacred, many years later.</description>
